# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

NBA Game Log Analytics (GLA) - A web application for analyzing NBA game statistics using "Four Factors" and "Eight Factors" decomposition models. The app shows how much each statistical factor (shooting, ball handling, rebounding, free throws) contributed to a game's outcome.

## Development Commands

### Backend (FastAPI)
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate  # setup only
pip install -r requirements.txt                   # setup only
python main.py                                    # starts server at http://localhost:8000
```
API docs available at http://localhost:8000/docs

### Frontend (React/Vite)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install       # setup only
npm run dev       # starts dev server at http://localhost:5173
npm run build     # production build
npm run preview   # preview production build
```

### Admin CLI (Data Updates & Contributions)
Located at `backend/admin/cli.py`. Manages the external NBA_Data repository.
```bash
cd backend
python admin/cli.py update-data --season 2024-25
python admin/cli.py git-status
```

### Contribution JSON Generation (Current Process)
Contribution JSONs are generated by `backend/admin/generate_contributions.py` into the external `NBA_Data` repo:
```bash
cd backend
python admin/generate_contributions.py --season 2025-26 --repo-dir ../NBA_Data
python admin/generate_contributions.py --repo-dir ../NBA_Data   # all seasons
```
Current training-window design for per-game contribution JSONs:
- Seasons `2001-02` onward: train on `current season games before game date + up to 7 prior seasons`.
- `2000-01` only: in-sample exception (train on full 2000-01 season) to avoid missing game entries.
- Possession usage: always use actual possessions from `box_score_advanced_XXXX-XX.csv` (no 0.44 possession approximation for turnover rate logic).
- Regeneration scope guidance:
  - Single-season-only logic/data fix: regenerate just that season with `--season`.
  - Training-window or factor-calculation changes used across seasons: regenerate all contribution files.

## Architecture

### Backend Structure
- **main.py** - FastAPI app entry point, CORS configuration
- **routers/api.py** - All API endpoints under `/api` prefix
- **services/data_loader.py** - Fetches CSV data from GitHub (millxing/NBA_Data), caches responses
- **services/calculations.py** - Four/Eight Factors computations, league aggregates, trend series
- **services/cache.py** - TTL-based in-memory cache
- **schemas/models.py** - Pydantic models for API responses
- **config.py** - Data source URLs, LLM config, season helpers

### Frontend Structure
- **src/App.jsx** - React Router setup with 5 routes
- **src/api.js** - API client functions (getSeasons, getGames, getDecomposition, etc.)
- **src/pages/** - Page components: Home, FourFactor, LeagueSummary, Trends, ContributionAnalysis
- **src/components/Layout.jsx** - Shared navigation layout
- **src/hooks/usePersistedState.js** - Custom hook for localStorage-persisted state

### Data Flow
1. Backend fetches raw CSV data from GitHub (team_game_logs, box_score_advanced, linescores)
2. Data is normalized and cached in memory (1 hour TTL)
3. Game Analysis decomposition is served from pre-generated contribution JSON files in `NBA_Data/contributions/`
4. Additional calculations are performed on-demand (league summary, trends, contribution analysis)
5. Frontend calls API endpoints and renders data with Recharts

### Key Concepts
- **Four Factors**: eFG%, BH%, OREB%, FT Rate - metrics that explain game outcomes
- **Eight Factors**: Same as Four Factors but split into home and road team contributions centered on league averages
- **Decomposition**: Uses linear regression coefficients from trained models to attribute net rating differential to each factor
- **Decomposition**: Uses pre-generated per-game contribution JSONs from `NBA_Data/contributions/`
- **Contribution Analysis**: Decomposes a team's net rating into contributions from each of the 8 factors over a date range

### Abbreviations
GA refers to the Game Analysis page
LS refers to League Summary page
ST refers to Statistical Trends page
CA refers to Contribution Analysis page
FF is Four-Factor decomp
EF is Eight-Factor decomp
BH is Ball Handling (1-TOV%)

### Game IDs
Game IDs are 10-digit zero-padded strings (e.g., `"0022400062"`). The raw CSVs store them as integers, which strips leading zeros. Always use `str(game_id).zfill(10)` when converting from CSV/numeric data to ensure the leading zeros are preserved. All APIs, contribution JSONs, and interpretation lookups expect the 10-digit format.

## Environment Variables

Backend (.env):
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` - CORS origins (default: localhost:5173,localhost:3000)
- `PORT` - Server port (default: 8000)

Frontend (.env):
- `VITE_API_URL` - Backend API URL (empty uses relative URLs with Vite proxy)
