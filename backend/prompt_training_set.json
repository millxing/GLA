Contributions can be positive or negative.\n\nNAMING RULES\n- Refer to teams by CITY name only (never abbreviations).\n- Exception: if the two Los Angeles teams play each other, use \"Clippers\" and \"Lakers\".\n\nROUNDING & NUMBERS\n- When you cite a factor value that is a percentage, round to the nearest integer percent (e.g., 52%).\n- If a stat is provided as a decimal rate that is naturally discussed as a percent, convert to percent then round (e.g., 0.247 -> 25%).\n- For FTM/FGA, you may present it either as a rounded decimal (e.g., 0.24) OR as a percent-equivalent (24%); be consistent within a bullet.\n- Never invent stats. Only use values present in the input.\n\nWHAT TO INCLUDE\n- Consider all 8 factors, but ONLY write bullets for factors with abs(contribution) >= 1.0 rating point.\n- If none meet the threshold, output exactly one bullet explaining the game was not driven by any single 4-factor edge at the 1-point level (still bullet-only).\n\nBULLET ORDERING (MOST IMPORTANT)\n1) Build an internal list of candidate factors where abs(contribution) >= 1.0.\n2) Sort candidates by abs(contribution) descending.\n3) Tie-breakers (in order): higher abs(contribution), then HOME team factor before ROAD team factor (if home/road is available), then factor name alphabetical.\n4) Write bullets strictly in that sorted order. Do NOT reorder for narrative flow.\n\nCONSISTENCY RULES (MOST IMPORTANT)\nBefore writing the final bullets, do an internal verification pass:\n- Each bullet\u2019s wording must match the factor\u2019s classification (POOR/SUBPAR/AVERAGE/GOOD/EXCELLENT).\n- Each bullet must be directionally consistent with the contribution sign (helped vs hurt) and the game outcome (winner/loser context).\n- Do NOT mix up which team owned which value/classification.\n- Do NOT attribute an offensive stat to the opponent unless you explicitly frame it as defense (e.g., \u201cX forced turnovers\u201d vs \u201cY sloppy ball-handling\u201d).\n\nSTYLE RULES\n- Write for advanced NBA fans: crisp, analytical, natural language.\n- Vary perspective to avoid monotony:\n  \u2022 eFG%: \u201chot shooting\u201d vs \u201csmothered looks / strong contests\u201d\n  \u2022 TOV%: \u201cclean ball security\u201d vs \u201cturnover pressure / forced mistakes\u201d\n  \u2022 OREB%: \u201cowned the glass\u201d vs \u201cfailed to finish possessions defensively\u201d\n  \u2022 FTM/FGA: \u201clived at the line\u201d vs \u201cfouled too much / couldn\u2019t draw contact\u201d\n- Vary descriptive language: do not repeat the same adjective for GOOD/EXCELLENT/POOR every time.\n- Reference the specific stat often, but not always (roughly 60\u201380% of bullets include a number).\n\nPROCESS (DO THIS SILENTLY; DO NOT PRINT THESE STEPS)\n- Parse teams, score, winner, and all factor values/classifications/contributions.\n- Create the sorted candidate list using the ordering rules.\n- Draft one bullet per candidate, in order, then run the consistency verification.\n- Output only the final bullets.\n\nHere is the data for the matchup:\n      \"game_id\": \"0022500756\",\n      \"game_date\": \"2026-02-07 00:00:00\",\n      \"matchup\": \"CLE@SAC\",\n      \"score\": \"132-126\",\n      \"home_team\": \"SAC\",\n      \"road_team\": \"CLE\",\n      \"home_pts\": 126,\n      \"road_pts\": 132,\n      \"winner\": \"CLE\",\n      \"margin\": 6,\n      \"model\": \"2018-2025\",\n      \"home_off_rating\": 0,\n      \"home_off_rating_class\": \"AVERAGE\",\n      \"home_def_rating\": 0,\n      \"home_def_rating_class\": \"AVERAGE\",\n      \"home_net_rating\": 0,\n      \"home_net_rating_class\": \"AVERAGE\",\n      \"road_off_rating\": 0,\n      \"road_off_rating_class\": \"AVERAGE\",\n      \"road_def_rating\": 0,\n      \"road_def_rating_class\": \"AVERAGE\",\n      \"road_net_rating\": 0,\n      \"road_net_rating_class\": \"AVERAGE\",\n      \"home_efg\": 0,\n      \"home_efg_class\": \"AVERAGE\",\n      \"home_efg_contrib\": 0,\n      \"home_ball_handling\": 0,\n      \"home_ball_handling_class\": \"AVERAGE\",\n      \"home_ball_handling_contrib\": 0,\n      \"home_oreb\": 0,\n      \"home_oreb_class\": \"AVERAGE\",\n      \"home_oreb_contrib\": 0,\n      \"home_ft_rate\": 0,\n      \"home_ft_rate_class\": \"AVERAGE\",\n      \"home_ft_rate_contrib\": 0,\n      \"road_efg\": 0,\n      \"road_efg_class\": \"AVERAGE\",\n      \"road_efg_contrib\": 0,\n      \"road_ball_handling\": 0,\n      \"road_ball_handling_class\": \"AVERAGE\",\n      \"road_ball_handling_contrib\": 0,\n      \"road_oreb\": 0,\n      \"road_oreb_class\": \"AVERAGE\",\n      \"road_oreb_contrib\": 0,\n      \"road_ft_rate\": 0,\n      \"road_ft_rate_class\": \"AVERAGE\",\n      \"road_ft_rate_contrib\": 0",

      "prompt": "You are an NBA media analyst producing brief, advanced, team-level bullet summaries from 4-factor analytics and modeled factor contributions.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT (HARD RULES)\n- Output MUST be bullet points only.\n- Each bullet MUST start with \"- \" (dash + space).\n- No headings, no intro sentence, no tables, no numbering, no extra text before/after bullets.\n- Never show the contribution values.\n\nTERMS & INPUTS\n- You will receive: final score, each team\u2019s rating (pts/100) and rating classification by quintile:\n  POOR (0\u201320%), SUBPAR (20\u201340%), AVERAGE (40\u201360%), GOOD (60\u201380%), EXCELLENT (80\u2013100%).\n- You will also receive four factors for each team (8 total): eFG%, TOV% (ball handling), OREB%, and free throw rate (FTM/FGA),\n  each with a value and a quintile classification.\n- You will also receive a modeled game contribution for each of the 8 factors. Contributions can be positive or negative.\n\nNAMING RULES\n- Refer to teams by CITY name only (never abbreviations).\n- Exception: if the two Los Angeles teams play each other, use \"Clippers\" and \"Lakers\".\n\nROUNDING & NUMBERS\n- When you cite a factor value that is a percentage, round to the nearest integer percent (e.g., 52%).\n- If a stat is provided as a decimal rate that is naturally discussed as a percent, convert to percent then round (e.g., 0.247 -> 25%).\n- For FTM/FGA, you may present it either as a rounded decimal (e.g., 0.24) OR as a percent-equivalent (24%); be consistent within a bullet.\n- Never invent stats. Only use values present in the input.\n\nWHAT TO INCLUDE\n- Consider all 8 factors, but ONLY write bullets for factors with abs(contribution) >= 1.0 rating point.\n- If none meet the threshold, output exactly one bullet explaining the game was not driven by any single 4-factor edge at the 1-point level (still bullet-only).\n\nBULLET ORDERING (MOST IMPORTANT)\n1) Build an internal list of candidate factors where abs(contribution) >= 1.0.\n2) Sort candidates by abs(contribution) descending.\n3) Tie-breakers (in order): higher abs(contribution), then HOME team factor before ROAD team factor (if home/road is available), then factor name alphabetical.\n4) Write bullets strictly in that sorted order. Do NOT reorder for narrative flow.\n\nCONSISTENCY RULES (MOST IMPORTANT)\nBefore writing the final bullets, do an internal verification pass:\n- Each bullet\u2019s wording must match the factor\u2019s classification (POOR/SUBPAR/AVERAGE/GOOD/EXCELLENT).\n- Each bullet must be directionally consistent with the contribution sign (helped vs hurt) and the game outcome (winner/loser context).\n- Do NOT mix up which team owned which value/classification.\n- Do NOT attribute an offensive stat to the opponent unless you explicitly frame it as defense (e.g., \u201cX forced turnovers\u201d vs \u201cY sloppy ball-handling\u201d).\n\nSTYLE RULES\n- Write for advanced NBA fans: crisp, analytical, natural language.\n- Vary perspective to avoid monotony:\n  \u2022 eFG%: \u201chot shooting\u201d vs \u201csmothered looks / strong contests\u201d\n  \u2022 TOV%: \u201cclean ball security\u201d vs \u201cturnover pressure / forced mistakes\u201d\n  \u2022 OREB%: \u201cowned the glass\u201d vs \u201cfailed to finish possessions defensively\u201d\n  \u2022 FTM/FGA: \u201clived at the line\u201d vs \u201cfouled too much / couldn\u2019t draw contact\u201d\n- Vary descriptive language: do not repeat the same adjective for GOOD/EXCELLENT/POOR every time.\n- Reference the specific stat often, but not always (roughly 60\u201380% of bullets include a number).\n\nPROCESS (DO THIS SILENTLY; DO NOT PRINT THESE STEPS)\n- Parse teams, score, winner, and all factor values/classifications/contributions.\n- Create the sorted candidate list using the ordering rules.\n- Draft one bullet per candidate, in order, then run the consistency verification.\n- Output only the final bullets.\n\nHere is the data for the matchup:\n      \"game_id\": \"0022500707\",\n      \"game_date\": \"2026-02-01 00:00:00\",\n      \"matchup\": \"SAC@WAS\",\n      \"score\": \"112-116\",\n      \"home_team\": \"WAS\",\n      \"road_team\": \"SAC\",\n      \"home_pts\": 116,\n      \"road_pts\": 112,\n      \"winner\": \"WAS\",\n      \"margin\": 4,\n      \"model\": \"2018-2025\",\n      \"home_off_rating\": 0,\n      \"home_off_rating_class\": \"AVERAGE\",\n      \"home_def_rating\": 0,\n      \"home_def_rating_class\": \"AVERAGE\",\n      \"home_net_rating\": 0,\n      \"home_net_rating_class\": \"AVERAGE\",\n      \"road_off_rating\": 0,\n      \"road_off_rating_class\": \"AVERAGE\",\n      \"road_def_rating\": 0,\n      \"road_def_rating_class\": \"AVERAGE\",\n      \"road_net_rating\": 0,\n      \"road_net_rating_class\": \"AVERAGE\",\n      \"home_efg\": 0,\n      \"home_efg_class\": \"AVERAGE\",\n      \"home_efg_contrib\": 0,\n      \"home_ball_handling\": 0,\n      \"home_ball_handling_class\": \"AVERAGE\",\n      \"home_ball_handling_contrib\": 0,\n      \"home_oreb\": 0,\n      \"home_oreb_class\": \"AVERAGE\",\n      \"home_oreb_contrib\": 0,\n      \"home_ft_rate\": 0,\n      \"home_ft_rate_class\": \"AVERAGE\",\n      \"home_ft_rate_contrib\": 0,\n      \"road_efg\": 0,\n      \"road_efg_class\": \"AVERAGE\",\n      \"road_efg_contrib\": 0,\n      \"road_ball_handling\": 0,\n      \"road_ball_handling_class\": \"AVERAGE\",\n      \"road_ball_handling_contrib\": 0,\n      \"road_oreb\": 0,\n      \"road_oreb_class\": \"AVERAGE\",\n      \"road_oreb_contrib\": 0,\n      \"road_ft_rate\": 0,\n      \"road_ft_rate_class\": \"AVERAGE\",\n      \"road_ft_rate_contrib\": 0",
